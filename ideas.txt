1. Accepting a pandas dataframe, consisting of OHLCV data from the user to predict prices using Monte Carlo 
   Simulation. This eliminates the users efforts of providing a definite value for volatility.
2. Currently the Monte Carlo model is predicting data only for a single timestamp. Figure out how to plot the 
   predicted price as a function of time until maturity.
   Results of all the simulations will be plot on the same graph, helping visualise the subtle trends based 
   on the density of the plots.
3. Building a comprehensive test suite for each model implemented on each option type, displaying the accuracy
   of each model.
4. A Jupyter Notebook detailing each use case.
